    <h2>Welcome</h2><p>At LatencyLab, I provide specialized IT consulting and infrastructure solutions that help businesses operate with speed, security, and reliability. My work focuses on optimizing networks to reduce latency, deploying high-availability servers, and implementing secure backup and virtualization systems that scale with client needs. I also design and maintain custom IT environments—ranging from small business file sharing setups to enterprise-grade virtual machine hosting—while ensuring smooth day-to-day operations through proactive monitoring and remote support. By combining hands-on technical expertise with a deep understanding of business workflows, I help clients streamline their IT systems, protect their data, and maximize overall performance.</p>
